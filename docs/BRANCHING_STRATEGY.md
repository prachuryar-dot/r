# 🌿 Branching Strategy & Deployment Workflow

This document outlines the branching strategy and deployment workflow for the Pattem Estates project, ensuring proper code management and deployment to different environments.

## 📋 Branch Structure

### 🌍 Environment Branches

| Branch  | Environment | Purpose                | Deployment                      |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `main`  | Production  | Live application       | Auto-deploy to production       |
| `stage` | Staging     | Pre-production testing | Auto-deploy to staging          |
| `test`  | Testing     | Integration testing    | Auto-deploy to test environment |

### 🔄 Branch Flow

```
Feature Branch → test → stage → main
     ↓           ↓       ↓       ↓
   Development → Test → Staging → Production
```

## 🚫 Branch Protection Rules

### ❌ Direct Commits Prohibited

**NO DIRECT COMMITS** are allowed to the following branches:

- `main` (Production)
- `stage` (Staging)
- `test` (Testing)

### ✅ Required Workflow

All changes must follow this workflow:

1. **Create Feature Branch** from appropriate base branch
2. **Develop & Test** locally
3. **Create Pull Request** to target environment branch
4. **Code Review** by team members
5. **Merge** only after approval
6. **Deploy** automatically after merge

## 📝 Branch Naming Conventions

### Feature Branches

```
feature/component-name
feature/user-authentication
feature/payment-integration
```

### Bug Fix Branches

```
bugfix/issue-description
bugfix/login-error
bugfix/button-styling
```

### Hotfix Branches

```
hotfix/critical-issue
hotfix/security-patch
hotfix/performance-fix
```

### Release Branches

```
release/version-number
release/v1.2.0
release/v2.0.0
```

## 🔄 Workflow Process

### 1. Development Workflow

```bash
# Start from main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-component

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new component"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/new-component
```

### 2. Pull Request Process

#### To Test Environment

```bash
# Create PR from feature branch to test
# Target: test branch
# Base: feature/your-branch
```

#### To Staging Environment

```bash
# Create PR from test to stage
# Target: stage branch
# Base: test branch
```

#### To Production Environment

```bash
# Create PR from stage to main
# Target: main branch
# Base: stage branch
```

## 🛡️ Branch Protection Configuration

### Required Settings for Protected Branches

#### Main Branch Protection

- ✅ **Require linear history**
- ✅ **Include administrators**
- ✅ **Restrict deletions**

#### Stage Branch Protection

- ✅ **Require pull request reviews before merging**
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- ✅ **Restrict pushes that create files that are larger than 100 MB**
- ✅ **Include administrators**
- ✅ **Restrict deletions**

#### Test Branch Protection

- ✅ **Require pull request reviews before merging**
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- ✅ **Restrict pushes that create files that are larger than 100 MB**
